o2_flag means debugging output for running
compiler with the char for that flag.

in symbol table, I don't separate the scopes
for the formals and the locals - if they aren't
connected in the "next" linked list then they
are part of the local variables for the procedure.
I also include the AST nodes for the instructions
in my ST output.
